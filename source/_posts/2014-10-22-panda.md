Synchronization
-------------------

StackEdit can be combined with <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** and <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** to have your documents saved in the *Cloud*. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.

> **Note:**

> - Full access to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can be configured in the settings.
> - Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.
> - If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.


### UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:

```flow
st=>start: Start
e=>end
op=>operation: My Operation
cond=>condition: Yes or No?

st->op->cond
cond(yes)->e
cond(no)->op
```
